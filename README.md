# HTML Practice – MDN First Module Exercise

This page contains is my final test for the **first HTML module** from [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/).
The goal is to practice and demonstrate the use of various core HTML elements, including semantic structure and accessibility features.

## Requirements

The page must include the following:

- ✅ Headings: Use heading elements at appropriate levels (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) to structure your content clearly and semantically.

- ✅ Paragraphs

- ✅ Lists: Include the three types of lists:
    - **Unordered list (`<ul>`)**
    - **Ordered list (`<ol>`)**
    - **Description list (`<dl>`)**

- ✅ Callout

- ✅ Semantic Text

- ✅ Images

- ✅ Videos
    - One **internal video**
    - One **external video**

- ✅ Internal Links

- ✅ External Links

## Accessibility

> All elements must include alternative text where applicable and follow accessibility best practices.

This includes:

* `alt` attributes for images
* `aria-label` or `aria-describedby` for multimedia
* Keyboard-navigable elements
* Proper use of semantic tags for screen reader support
